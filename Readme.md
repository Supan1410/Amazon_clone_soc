In the first phase of the project I started with setup and downloading of flutter and Android studio which is required to test the app which provides emulator of a phone to test the app. I added a screenshot showing the same.

In second phase, I learnt flutter(front end) which is used to create app interface and all the things that will be visible to user. At the end of second phase I created a world time app which shows time of different countries. Although that API is no longer working but still I learnt creating the app interface and hands on working with flutter. 

In third phase, I learnt backend which is required for the app to function well and includes learning of Node.js to implement different features required for a app to function. I learnt express.js for all routing, middleware and API creation. Along with this I learned MongoDB essentials for managing data to be stored for the project. 

Now currently I have just started with final project to create Amazon clone app.
